# Labasi - 2-Minute Pitch Script

**Total Time:** 2:00 | **Word Count:** ~310 | **Pace:** 150 wpm

---

## OPENING: The Problem [0:00 - 0:25]

*[Start with confident posture. Make eye contact. Speak slowly here - let the scene build.]*

Picture this: You're in a cleanroom, hands in gloves, carefully aligning a wafer under the electron beam. You need to check the dose parameters from your last successful run.

*[Pause 1 beat]*

Your phone? In the gowning room. Your notebook? Across the facility. Your hands? **Occupied.**

*[Slight pause - let it land]*

**In research labs, your hands are NEVER free when you need information most.**

*[Speed up slightly, dismissive tone]*

And traditional voice assistants? They fail researchers. Tedious confirmations. Zero domain knowledge. They just don't get it.

---

## THE SOLUTION: Introducing Labasi [0:25 - 1:00]

*[Energy shift - now you're excited. This is the good news.]*

**Labasi** is a voice-first AI assistant PURPOSE-BUILT for laboratories.

*[Hold up one finger]*

**First - the Intelligent Logbook.** Every conversation becomes searchable research history. Notes extracted automatically. Todos tracked. Everything timestamped and linked to your projects.

*[Gesture: throwing something away]*

No more lost sticky notes.

*[Two fingers]*

**Second - Proactive Intelligence.** Labasi edits notes and todos without asking permission. Describe your results? It logs the data AND suggests next steps.

*[Dismissive wave]*

No more "would you like me to save that?" confirmations.

*[Three fingers]*

**Third - Domain Tools.** Instant PubChem access for molecular weights and safety data. A knowledge base that recognizes misheard lab terms. Full awareness of YOUR project history.

---

## DEMO: Show, Don't Tell [1:00 - 1:40]

*[Shift to storytelling mode. Paint the picture.]*

Let me show you. You're at the fluorescence microscope:

*[Gesture like speaking to an assistant]*

"Labasi, what's the molecular weight of Cy5 NHS ester?"

*[Snap fingers - it's instant]*

Labasi returns **791.99 g/mol** from PubChem - PLUS the extinction coefficient you'll need for concentration verification.

*[Continue the scenario]*

Now you're running your experiment:

"I'm seeing 4500 counts on the antenna versus 300 on glass, but photobleaching after 45 seconds."

*[Count on fingers as you list - show the magic]*

Labasi calculates your **15-fold enhancement factor**... logs it to your project notes... AND creates a todo to test oxygen scavengers for the photobleaching.

*[Spread hands - emphasize this point]*

**All automatically.** You never stopped pipetting.

---

## CLOSING: The Vision [1:40 - 2:00]

*[Slow down. This is the emotional hook. Make eye contact.]*

Think about every lab notebook entry ever lost. Every brilliant idea forgotten between the microscope and the desk. Every hour wasted searching for "that protocol I DEFINITELY wrote down somewhere."

*[Pause 1 beat]*

Labasi eliminates these friction points - so researchers can focus on what matters:

*[Final pause for emphasis]*

**The science.**

*[Deliver the tagline with conviction]*

**Labasi. Because your best ideas shouldn't require free hands.**

*[Hold for applause / questions]*

# Speaker Notes & Tips

## Preparation
- [ ] Practice with timer - aim for 1:55 to leave breathing room
- [ ] Know where to cut if running long (trim demo section)
- [ ] Have live demo ready as backup if Q&A asks for it

## Delivery Reminders
| Section | Energy Level | Pace |
|---------|--------------|------|
| Problem | Calm, building tension | Slow |
| Solution | Excited, confident | Medium-fast |
| Demo | Storytelling, animated | Medium |
| Closing | Sincere, inspiring | Slow |

## Key Emphasis Words
- **NEVER** free (problem)
- **PURPOSE-BUILT** (solution intro)
- **ACTS** without permission (proactive)
- **All automatically** (demo payoff)
- **The science** (vision)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Don't rush the opening scene - let audience visualize it
2. Don't apologize or hedge ("kind of", "sort of", "basically")
3. Don't read - know this cold
4. Don't forget the pauses - they're part of the pitch

## If You Have Extra Time
Add this after the demo section:

> "The technology? Claude AI enhanced with MCP tools - PubChem for chemistry, a custom knowledge base, and your complete project history. All through natural voice conversation."

## Backup Sound Bites (for Q&A)
- "We're turning every voice conversation into structured research data."
- "It's like having a lab notebook that writes itself."
- "Researchers shouldn't have to choose between doing science and documenting it."
